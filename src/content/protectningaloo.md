As you know, the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has just released a major report that warns of the increasing pressure on Exmouth Gulf’s environment and calls for the protection of its unique and globally significant values.

Despite the Gulf’s fragility and global importance, one major industrial development after another has been proposed for the area, from oil and gas pipeline fabrication, to a large-scale salt production proposal (K+S Salt).

The latest is the Gascoyne Gateway industrial port proposed to be built adjacent to Qualing Pool, a beautiful, tranquil and rare freshwater oasis, and one of the sensitive areas the EPA has specifically recommended for a high level of protection. 

Just offshore from Qualing Pool is one of the world’s most important humpback whale resting and nursery areas. Humpback whale mothers and calves need to rest undisturbed to build up their reserves before the arduous migration to Antarctica. Yet, incredibly, this is where the industrial port and shipping channel would be built. Dredgers would remove more than one million cubic metres of seafloor to enable massive ships to reach the port in an area also known for its dugongs, dolphins, sponges, corals and diverse fish species.
  
Minister, you will understand why I and many thousands of others find proposals like this to be unacceptable and why we want you to end the cycle of industrial threats to the Gulf. I urge you to protect Exmouth Gulf, Ningaloo, and secure its world-class tourism economy and the growing marine research, cultural tourism and education opportunities that complement the area’s natural and cultural assets.

I call on you to make clear as a matter of urgency that your Government will protect Exmouth Gulf and remove the threat of industrial development like the Gascoyne Gateway industrial port.

Now is the moment to demonstrate your leadership and seize the opportunity to leave a positive and sustainable legacy for Exmouth Gulf, Ningaloo.
