I am writing to you as your constituent to express my grave concerns over the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the need for urgent action.

Over a year after the fall of Kabul, and after almost two decades of intervention the Australian government has a moral obligation to take immediate action in response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.

The former Morrison government only committed to providing 16,500 additional humanitarian visas, spaced over 4 years. More than 211,100 people from Afghanistan have applied for humanitarian protection so far. Australia has a moral obligation to provide at least 20,000 emergency humanitarian visa places immediately.

Today, more than 71,500 people from Afghanistan call Australia home and contribute to Australia’s prosperity in our schools, hospitals, construction sites, in academia and more.

In light of this history and engagement between our two nations, I urge you to join the growing number of public voices and take proactive measures to secure:

- At least 20,000 emergency additional humanitarian visas for people escaping danger in Afghanistan.

- Granting of permanent protection to refugees from Afghanistan already in Australia on temporary visas. These people now face a heightened state of insecurity and cannot continue to live in limbo.

- Prioritising partner and family reunification visas of people from Afghanistan who are currently awaiting to be reunited with their family members in safety in Australia.

- Expediting the resettlement of translators, guides, Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and other personnel who assisted Australian and allied forces in the preceding 20 year military engagement.

- Lifting the ban on resettlement of refugees to Australia through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Indonesia.

- The provision of urgent humanitarian aid for the millions of people including children in Afghanistan facing starvation.

I urge you and your fellow MPs to please consider the action points and voice your strong support for continuing Australia’s long relationship with the people of Afghanistan.

I look forward to your response.
