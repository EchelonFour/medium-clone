I would like to politely request the illumination of your building on 28 February 2022 for Rare Disease Day to recognise the challenges faced by people with a rare condition and stand in solidarity. Please can this email be passed on to the relevant team?
 
Here is some more information about the day for your consideration. 
 
Despite having different conditions people with rare conditions face common challenges. Three quarters of all rare diseases affect children, and we estimate that rare diseases are responsible for about a third of infant mortality in the UK. On average it takes four years for someone with a rare condition to receive an accurate diagnosis. Additionally, there are licensed medicinal products available for only a small minority of rare diseases making it incredibly difficult for patients to access potentially life-changing treatments.
 
The 28 February 2022 is Rare Disease Day, a patient-led awareness day to raise awareness for the over 300 million people worldwide living with a rare disease. Rare Disease Day began in 2008 with 18 countries. Today, participation has grown significantly with events in over 100 countries in 2021. In February 2021, over 100 landmarks were illuminated in over 38 countries around the world for Rare Disease Day. This year, homes across the globe will also be illuminated at 7pm on 28 February to participate in awareness-raising and show solidarity.
 
 The Rare Disease Day colours are blue, pink, green and purple. Please find a colour guide here - http://download2.rarediseaseday.org/Colours_to_request.pdf.
 
Thank you for considering our application and I look forward to hearing from you.
