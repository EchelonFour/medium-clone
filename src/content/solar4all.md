Dear Energy Minister, 

Like health and education, electricity is an essential service that is critical to almost every part of our lives, yet 35% of Australians are currently locked out of the bill-saving and environmental benefits of rooftop solar. 

As electricity prices and carbon pollution continue to rise, it is not good enough that low-income households, renters, people living in an apartment, or homes without a suitable roof are unable to access solutions like rooftop solar.

Research by Community Power Agency and the Institute for Sustainable Futures found that solutions exist to ensure all Australians can access the benefits of rooftop solar. One of the best solutions is Solar Gardens.

We commend your government’s support of household solar, but request that policy support be extended to all locked out energy customers.

As Energy Minister will you ensure that all Australians can take part in the shift to renewable energy by establishing the Solar for All Policy Package including:
1. Fund real world Solar Garden pilot projects 
2. Establish a means-tested Solar for All rebate
