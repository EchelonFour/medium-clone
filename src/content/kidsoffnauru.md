Thank you for your addressing the MEDICAL CRISIS facing people in Australia's offshore detention! Sick and injured people under our care, will now be able to receive necessary treatment. 

I wanted to say how much I appreciate the democracy in action I've witnessed over the last month with the negotiations and decisions on the refugee medical evacuation bill. 

I wrote to you recently to ask you to back the bill on my behalf, and I am so happy with the result. I know it has not been easy to maintain a true path in the face of the Government's border security rhetoric. The transparent, enforceable and timely process detailed in Bill provides a medical solution to a medical problem but also upholds our border protection.

I'll be very proud to support you again in the future, so long as a commitment to Australia's humanitarian and human rights record remains among your priorities.
