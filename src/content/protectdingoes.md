title: Protect Dingoes

Federal, state and territory governments are failing to protect dingoes.  

At present the fate of dingoes is decided by sheep and cattle producers, industry representative bodies, pesticide companies and other industry interests. They do not represent my interests.  

I respectfully call on you to:

1.     Use the taxon Canis dingo and term dingo, not ‘wild dog’, when communicating with stakeholders, so that it is clear what animal is being targeted / killed. 

2.     Lobby the Minister for the Environment to approve nomination for dingo loss as a key threatening process under the EPBC Act. 

3.     Abandon the current National Wild Dog Action Plan and produce a new framework that prioritises the perspectives of Aboriginal people, independent ecologists and the general public.

4.     Take responsibility for decisions about dingoes’ future away from industry organisations with a vested interest in current management techniques and profits over public interests

5.     Ban cruel and indiscriminate use of 1080 and strychnine poison in Australia. 

6.     Invest in research and pilot programs for non-lethal livestock protection methods with a view to developing long term, sustainable strategies for dingoes and livestock to safely co-exist within the Australian landscape.


REASONS FOR MY REQUEST

Dingoes are a majestic, keystone native Australian species.

The dingo is recognised as a native Australian species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 section 528 which defines a native species as one that was present in Australia before the year 1400 (2).

Dingoes have many physical and behavioural features that distinguish them from other canids. These features allow them to survive in challenging Australian environments (3).

Dingoes have been incorporated into Aboriginal society.  They are widely recognised as part of creation, “dreaming” knowledge and law (4, 5).

Dingoes are valued globally as an iconic Australian species.

As a native apex predator dingoes play a critical role in ecosystem resilience and stability (6-10).  Their role includes:
- Picking off old, sick and genetically weak individuals, slowing the spread of disease and ensuring healthy populations of their prey species.
- Preying on both introduced and native herbivores, regulating the number of kangaroos, rabbits, feral pigs etc resulting in improved vegetation cover.
- Keeping foxes and feral cats in check, which in turn gives life to many small-medium mammals, marsupials, native birds and other species.

The taxonomic status of dingoes is political and contentious. Science is proving that dingoes are a distinct species (Canis dingo) – genetically, behaviourally, morphologically (10) - and yet vested interests promote them as ‘wild dogs’, ‘pests’ or ‘feral’ domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) to justify lethal control (11, 12).  A major recent study of public understandings found that most people (over 80%) were not aware that the targets of “wild dog” management included dingoes.  Most respondents considered dingoes native to Australia (over 80%) and there was low level of approval of lethal control of dingoes (13).

Failure to recognise dingoes as a separate species, misinformation that they are an ‘introduced’ species and / or exaggerated claims of hybridisation with domestic dogs diminishes their critical role as Australia’s native apex land predators

This mess of terminology is misleading and confusing.  Language and classifications used by government should be supported by independent scientists, not dictated by industry / industry affiliated ‘experts’.

Dingoes may prey upon sheep and, sometimes, cattle especially if the stock are weak or there is a lack of other prey (increased stock predation has been associated with poor husbandry practices and biodiversity destruction) (14).

In response to perceived risks to stock, dingoes are being killed on an industrial scale across Australia through widespread ‘lethal control’ under the National Wild Dog Action Plan (15).  Methods include trapping, shooting and, most commonly poisoning, including aerial dropping of 1080.  The RSPCA does not regard 1080 or traps as humane.  Traps incorporating strychnine laced clothes are considered to be especially cruel (16, 17).

However, the real scale of threat posed by dingoes to the wool and meat livestock industries is small.  For example, in New South Wales and Victoria annual sheep losses are reported as less than 0.01% of the total flock. ‘Wild dog’ predation accounts for only a fraction of this (18). Research conducted in central and Northern Australia has shown lethal control of dingoes does not reduce cattle production impacts (19, 20). A growing number of producers are reporting that dingoes can be valuable partners in agriculture (21).

The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) is the Australian Government's principal piece of environment legislation (2). 

The EPBC Act aims to protect Australia's native species and ecological communities by providing for:

- Identification and listing of species as threatened
- Recognition of key threatening processes 
- The dingo has been frequently nominated for protection under the EPBC Act as a threatened species and dingo loss as a key threatening process, due to the cascading effects of the loss or removal of dingoes from Australian landscapes (22, 23)

In 2017 the Threatened Species Scientific Committee recommended that dingo loss be included in the proposed priority assessment list for key threatening processes.  This decision was rejected by the then Environment Minister and was consequently excluded from consideration thereafter (23). 

Australia’s Framework for dingo management is the ‘National Wild Dog Action Plan’ (The Plan). This Plan is extremely dangerous for dingoes’ survival as a species.   

The Plan is a "livestock industry-driven initiative". The copyright for the Plan is held by © 2020 Australian Wool Innovation Ltd.   It unabashedly represents the interests of meat livestock, wool and pesticide industry operators over the interests of the environment, culture and dingoes (15).
